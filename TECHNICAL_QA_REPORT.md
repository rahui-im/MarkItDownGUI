**Code Evidence:**
```python
# Lines 206-219: Primary integration in conversion workflow
if self._save_to_original_dir:
    output_path = resolve_markdown_output_path(
        source_path=file_info.path,
        preserve_structure=False,
        output_base_dir=file_info.path.parent,
        ensure_unique=True
    )
else:
    output_path = resolve_markdown_output_path(
        source_path=file_info.path,
        preserve_structure=True,
        output_base_dir=self.output_directory,
        ensure_unique=True
    )
```

- ✅ All existing method signatures maintained (3/3 key methods preserved)
- ✅ Configuration options (`save_to_original_dir`, `output_directory`) preserved
- ✅ Graceful fallback mechanisms enable gradual migration

**Fallback Implementation:**
```python
# Lines 486-494: Fallback mechanism example
except (ValueError, OSError) as e:
    logger.error(f"원본 출력 경로 생성 실패: {e}")
    # 폴백으로 기존 방식 사용
    original_output_path = create_markdown_output_path(
        file_info.path, 
        self.output_directory if not self._save_to_original_dir else None,
        self._save_to_original_dir
    )
```
